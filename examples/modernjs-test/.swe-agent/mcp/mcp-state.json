This redundancy increases the overall bundle size, which is not optimal for performance.\n\n    #### General Solution\n\n    To address this issue, you can use Rspack's **SplitChunksPlugin** to extract common dependencies into a separate chunk. This ensures that the same package is not duplicated across multiple chunks, thereby reducing the bundle size.\n\n    For example, if **lodash** is being duplicated across different chunks, you can configure the **optimization.splitChunks** option in your Webpack configuration to extract **lodash** into a separate chunk:\n\n    ```\n    module.exports = {\n      optimization: {\n        splitChunks: {\n          cacheGroups: {\n            commons: {\n              test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]lodash[\\/]/,\n              name: 'lodash',\n              chunks: 'all',\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    };\n    ```\n\n    This configuration will automatically split out common dependencies (including those from `node_modules`) into separate chunks, ensuring that no package is duplicated across different chunks.\n\n  - E1004 ECMA Version Check:\n      #### Description\n      This rule is used to detect incompatible advanced syntax. When scanning the rule, the configuration of browserslist is prioritized.\n  ",
